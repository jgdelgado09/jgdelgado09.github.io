Hi, my name is Jose Delgado. I am a software developer/engineer with 4 years experience in mostly Healthcare IT.

Note: this is a work in progress and will be updated in the future.


I've worked in a clinical laboratory setting supporting a proprietary Lab Information System that is responsible for the reception and processing of specimens, storing of patient and doctor information, and communicating lab results to external entities such as providers or other labs. In that role I was responsible for the analysis of requirements and current software status, designing of new requests or enhancements, developing software requirements in a sprint-oriented environment, documenting test cases for QA, and triage of any issues affecting production. To do that, clear communication with stakeholders such as doctors and lab technicians was imperative.

Currently, I am part of a Health Information Exchange team where my main responsibility is the implementation and enhancement of interfaces needed to send and receive key patient and doctor data. As with my previous role, a similar SDLC is followed but with a greater need to communicate between different teams in charge of different products or services. Key knowledge of APIs, message brokers such as RabbitMQ, different message format such as JSON and XML, and other tools is important to properly implement requirements. 

I am also member of the Texas National Guard and before that Active Duty Army, serving a total of 10 years so far. During that time, I've deployed to U.A.E. and Jordan where my main responsibilities included network operations in all levels of the OSI model, mentorship of junior members, planning with key leaders to meet mission requirements, and overall leadership to peers and subordinates. 

In all of my roles I've put my passion for serving, learning, and programming to use to benefit other people. I believe service to others is one of the greatest joys and satisfactions I can experience because I know through my efforts someone's life is a little less difficult. 

Since I've mostly worked in Healthcare IT, my main forte is a language called ObjectScript supported by InterSystems. It is a typless language similar to Python, and is also very verbose like Java. I've also used C++, C and some C# but not to the extent needed to build anything significant. InterSystems has a variety of different technologies they created to service the healthcare and finance industries, some of which I have experience with like Cache, Healthshare, and their latest release Iris.

You might be wondering why my GitHub is lacking, and to be honest it's because I hardly used it in school and most of the version control systems I've used in my professional career are things like SVN or George James's Deltanji. So this is an exercise in expanding my knowledge to encompass more mainstream technologies.


I achieved my undergrad in Computer Science from The University of Texas at Dallas (Go Comets!) in Spring of 2019. I plan to return for an Executive Masters in Software Engineering in 2024; I was already accepted but had to defer enrollment due to my military obligations.


Most of my personal interests revolve around large data sets and the analysis of such information. This page will serve as a simple resume/CV of my experiences but also as a document of my journey to learn and experiment with certain non-domain specific technologies. Also, since AI is popular nowadays I will more than likely experiment some with that. However, I don't plan on creating some super complicated model that predicts weather patterns or recongizes images.
